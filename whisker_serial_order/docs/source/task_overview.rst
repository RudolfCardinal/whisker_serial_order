Task overview
=============

The task tests memory for serial position/order.

The task operates with a five-hole box (5 holes of the traditional 9-hole
box [#fiveholebox]_), with a rear food magazine at the back. All ‘holes’ have a
light inside and an infrared nosepoke detector; the food magazine can also
dispense pellets. Like this:

In brief, trials are as follows:

- Trials begin with illumination of the food magazine/tray, and the subject
  must respond.

- A sequence of lights is presented. For example, if a 4-light sequence is
  used, the task may aim to present 4-1-3-5. After each individual light
  presentation, the subject must acknowledge by responding to the location of
  the light, and after that to the magazine (again signalled by magazine light
  illumination).

- After the sequence has been presented and acknowledged, a choice of two of
  the presented lights is offered (e.g. 4, 3). The subject must choose the
  correct hole to answer the question: **“which one came first?”** Success
  leads to food.
