==============

---------------------

- Started. Released 21 Mar 2016.

Others, to v0.4.2
-----------------

...

v0.5.0 – Mar 2017
-----------------

- Changed from PySide to PyQt 5.8, following other projects (e.g. Starfeeder),
  as this is more stable and also allows Python 3.5.
- Added more test code (including command-line tests) for trial planning,
  following a query from YC, but this seems fine.
